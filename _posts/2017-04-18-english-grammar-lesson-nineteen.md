Antes de definirmos o simple past é importante ressaltarmos que os verbos em inglês têm formas básicas: Infinite (infinito), Simple Past(Passado), e Past Participle(Particípio Passado), das quais originam-se todos os outros tempos verbais.

De acordo com essas três formas verbais, classificamos os verbos Regulares e Irregulares.

Caracterizamos os verbos regulares pelo acréscimo do sufixo **ed** no "Simple Past" e no "Past Participle".

Os verbos irregulares não obedecem a nenhuma regra quanto a sua formação.


--|Infinitivo | Passado | Particípio Passado
--------------|------------|---------|--------------------
Verbo Regular | to open | opened | opened
Verbo Irregular | to go | went | gone  


Assim, para formarmos o "Simple Past" e o "Past Participle" dos verbos regulares basta acrescentarmos o sufixo **ed** ao infinitivo sem o **to**, mas para isso, devemos obedecer certas regras:

a) Os verbos terminados em **e** só recebem o sufixo **d**.

 - to change - changed
 - to close - closed
 - to drive - drived

b) Se o verbo terminar em **y** precedido de consoante, troca-se o **y** por **i** e acrescenta-se **ed**

 - to play - played
 - to obey - obeyed
 - to delay - delayed

c) Os verbos monossilábicos e os de duas sílabas, sendo a última tônica, terminados em consoante - vogal - consoante, terão a última consoante dobrada

 - to occurd - occured (ocorrer)
 - to prefer - preferred (preferir)
 - to rob - robbed (roubar)
 - to stop - stopped (parar)
